# Make a todo list

## Setup

Make a new html page with a nice header and an empty list of todo-items.

Add the first todo item. A to-do item consists of a `span` with text in it (the name of the todo), a button that says "mark done" and another button that says "mark undone" and finally a (disabled) check mark that's not yet checked. The text in this first item will be "make a todo list". This now looks like:

There's also a second todo item with the text "hi there I am not done".

Finally there's also a button underneath the list to make a summary of which todos are done:

Finally let's add the system fonts to our page: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif`
