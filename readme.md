# Make a todo list

## Setup

Make a new html page with a nice header and an empty list of todo-items.

Add the first todo item. A to-do item consists of a `span` with text in it (the name of the todo), a button that says "mark done" and another button that says "mark undone" and finally a (disabled) check mark that's not yet checked. The text in this first item will be "make a todo list". This now looks like:

Finally there's also a button underneath the list to make a summary of which todos are done:

Finally let's add the system fonts to our page: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif`

## Marking items as done

If a user presses on the "mark as done" button, you should toggle the checked-ness of the checkbox. If you click done, it should look like this:

## Adding a second item

There's also a second todo item with the text "hi there I am not done", which is added just like the first item. If you click this "mark done" button it should also work

They should both be able to be marked as done:
